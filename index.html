    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm an incoming student at the University of Toronto intending to pursue a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (through the Physical & Mathematical Sciences admission category). I love researching, programming, and building innovative projects. I'm deeply interested in computer science, mathematics, and engineering. I contribute to <a href="https://mathcontestrepository.pythonanywhere.com/user/savir">the Math Contest Repository</a>, a nonprofit I founded to help students prepare for math contests. Currently, I'm building something in stealth with my friend, having recently started working on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/savirss">a $2,400 prototype</a>!</p>
    <p>Below are some fun work experiences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaled Foundations (2024):</strong> Researched ML models for robotics, implemented inference scripts, and recommended three models for the <a href="https://scaledfoundations.ai">GRID platform</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>University of Waterloo (2024):</strong> Built a GUI for a terminal-based software security project, showcased at <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2024">ICSE 2024</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>American Inn Ozark (2023):</strong> Developed a beta-stage website and a real-time reservation notification system for hotel management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy solving math problems, building software (and, more recently, hardware!), listening to classical music, playing VR games, and going out for walks. My skillset includes <strong>C/C++, Python, Java, web development, Docker, Linux, and SQL</strong>. For more, check out my <a href="/resume">résumé</a>.</p>
